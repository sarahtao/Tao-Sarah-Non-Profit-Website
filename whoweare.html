		<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
		<p><strong>Grow</strong> was founded in 1989 by Erin Kayser who wanted to start a change when she realized the increasing grocery gap between low-income communities and high-income communities. Low-income communities have long suffered from the lack of fresh food and local grocery stores nearby, limiting their healthy living style. The lack of opportunities have caused a tremedous detriment to these communities, raising various issues one the most common one being obesity. Without any support system to rely on, Kayser founded Grow in order to close the gap for commmunities' access to fresh food. By creating a system that provides fresh food to families in need, Grow has grown to become one of the top leading non-profit organizations for equitable healthy living.</p>
